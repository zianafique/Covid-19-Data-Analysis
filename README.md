# Covid-19-Data-Analysis
I have used a covid 19 dataset. And used Tableau to analysis the dataset.
The tableau repository dashboard is what you have found the most reliable informations. 
It will show 
            1. The confirmed cases in specific days in specific country of the world
            2.  Total Confirmed cases based on the country
            3. TOtal deaths based on th e top 10 country having most deaths
            4.  iT will show both of the log view and acis view
            5. It will automatically show the animation of enhancing rate of te cases and deaths
